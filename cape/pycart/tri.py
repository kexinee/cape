:mod:`cape.pycart.tri`: Cart3D ``.tri`` file interface
=======================================================================

This module provides the utilities for interacting with Cart3D
triangulations or several other file formats with similar contents. This
includes annotated triangulations (including ``.triq`` files).

Triangulations can be read from a variety of formats, which are
tabulated below.

    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | Extension   | Description                              |
    +=============+==========================================+
    | ``.tri``    | Cart3D tri format, can be ASCII, Fortran |
    |             | unformatted (big- or little-endian), or  |
    |             | C-style stream                           |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``.triq``   | Annotated Cart3D tri format, any format. |
    |             | This format contains a number of state   |
    |             | variables at each point in addition to   |
    |             | the geometry information                 |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``.uh3d``   | UH3D format, similar to ``.tri`` but     |
    |             | names for faces                          |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``.surf``   | AFLR3 surface mesh; can include quads    |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``.unv``    | IDEAS format; very strange               |
    +-------------+------------------------------------------+

In addition to the main functions inherited from
:class:`cape.tri.TriBase`, the :class:`cape.tri.Triq` class has a few
methods that are particular to the state variables saved in Cart3D.

Cart3D also utilizes the GMP format to associate names with the faces of
component ID numbers. This is an XML format (standard name for the file
is ``Config.xml``) that associates a name for each of the component IDs
in a triangulation. In addition, groups of component IDs can be given a
name by defining "Parent" components in the XML file. Reading a
triangulation with such a configuration can be done with the following
commands.

    .. code-block:: python

        import cape.tri
        tri = cape.tri.Tri("Components.i.tri", c="Config.xml")

Note that Cart3D's interpretation of the XML file is very strict.  There cannot
be any component IDs mentioned in the XML file that are not present in the TRI
file.  In addition, there is no way for a component to have multiple parents.
For example, it is not possible to have a group that contains fins 1 and 2
while another group contains fins 1 and 3.

The module consists of individual classes that are built off of a base
triangulation class :class:`cape.tri.TriBase`.  Methods that are written for
the TriBase class apply to all other classes as well.
